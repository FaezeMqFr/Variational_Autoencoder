## What is this repository for?

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating the training and application of Variational Autoencoders (VAE) on two popular datasets: MNIST and CIFAR-10. VAEs are advanced generative models capable of learning data distributions and generating new data instances. This project explores generating new images of handwritten digits (MNIST) and small color images of various objects (CIFAR-10), along with delving into the latent space representations.

For detailed explanations of the VAE concepts and additional guidance, refer to the blog post on this topic here.

## Who do I talk to?

This project is designed for:
  -Educators: Demonstrating generative model principles.
  -Students: Learning about deep learning and generative models.
  -Researchers: Using this implementation as a base for further experimentation.
